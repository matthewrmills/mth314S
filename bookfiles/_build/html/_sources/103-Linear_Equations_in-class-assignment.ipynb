    "In the movie Groundhog day the main character \"Phil\" repeats the same day over and over again.  This is an iterative process where Phil learns from past mistakes until he has a \"perfect\" day.  The Groundhog movie is a fun analogy of iterative methods for solving linear equations. \n",
    "During class today we will write an iterative method (named after Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi) to solve the following system of equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 6x + 2y - ~z = 4~$$\n",
    "$$~ x + 5y + ~z = 3~$$\n",
    "$$ 2x +~ y + 4z = 27$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a basic outline of the Jacobi method algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize each of the variables as zero ($x_0 = 0, y_0 = 0, z_0 = 0$) \n",
    "2. Calculate the next iteration using the above equations and the values from the previous iterations. For example here is the formula for calculating $x_i$ from $y_{(i-1)}$ and $z_{(i-1)}$ based on the first equation:\n",
    "    $$x_i = \\frac{4 - 2y_{(i-1)} + z_{(i-1)}}{6} $$\n",
    "    Similarly, we can obtain the update for $y_i$ and $z_i$ from the second and third equations, respectively.\n",
    "3. Increment the iteration counter $(i = i + 1)$ and repeat Step 2.\n",
    "4. Stop when the answer \"converges\" or a maximum number of iterations has been reached. (ex. $i$ = 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT NOTE:** \n",
    "\n",
    "> A sufficient (but not necessary) condition for the method to converge is that the matrix A is strictly or irreducibly [diagonally dominant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonally_dominant_matrix). Strict row diagonal dominance means that for each row, the absolute value of the diagonal term is greater than the sum of absolute values of other terms. - From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_method)\n",
