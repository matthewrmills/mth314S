    "> A sports broadcaster wishes to predict how many Michigan residents prefer University of Michigan teams and how many prefer Michigan State teams. \n",
    "She noticed that, year after year, most people stick with their preferred team; however, about 5% of Michigan fans switch to Michigan State, and about 3% of Michigan State fans switch to Michigan each year. \n",
    "However, there is no noticeable difference in the state's population of 10 million's preference at large; in other words, it seems Michigan sports fans have reached a stationary distribution. What might that be?\n",
