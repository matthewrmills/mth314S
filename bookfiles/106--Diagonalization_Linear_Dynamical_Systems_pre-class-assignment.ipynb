    "**Definition**: A non-zero vector $x$ in $R^n$ is called an *eigenvector* of a $n\\times n$ matrix $A$ if $Ax$ is a scalar multiple of $x$. If $Ax = \\lambda x$, then $\\lambda$ is called the *eigenvalue* of $A$ corresponding to $x$.\n",

    "### Steps for finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to find $\\lambda$ and non-zero vector $x$ such that $Ax=\\lambda x$ for a $n\\times n$ matrix. \n",
    "1. We introduce an identity matrix $I$ of $n\\times n$. Then the equation becomes\n",
    "$$Ax = \\lambda I x$$\n",
    "$$Ax-\\lambda I x = 0$$\n",
    "$$(A-\\lambda I)x = 0$$\n",
    "2. This suggests that we want to find $\\lambda$ such that $(A-\\lambda I)x=0$ has a non-trivial solution. \n",
    "It is equivalent to that the matrix $A-\\lambda I$ is singular, i.e., has a determinant of $0$.\n",
    "$$|A-\\lambda I|=0$$\n",
    "3. The determinant is polynomial in $\\lambda$ (called the characteristic polynomial of $A$) with degree $n$. We solve this equation (called the characteristic equation) for all possible $\\lambda$ (eigenvalues).\n",
    "4. After finding the eigenvalues, we substitute them back into \n",
    "$$(A-\\lambda I)x=0$$\n",
    "and find the eigenvectors $x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's calculate eigenvalues for the following matrix: \n",
