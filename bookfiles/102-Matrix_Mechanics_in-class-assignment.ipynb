    "\n",
    "If we want to discuss the entries of a matrix then we need to use the specific index of the entry. This is typically given by the ordered pair describing which row and column the entry is in. For example the (2,2)-entry of the matrix $A$ given above is 4. We can write $A_{2,2} =4$, or sometime we will use lowercase letters for the entry: $a_{2,2} = 4$. As a whole matrix we have \n",

    "However with most computer languages the indexing starts with 0 and not 1. Therefore to get the (2,2)-entry of the matrix $A$ in python we need to subtract 1 from all our indices. In general when we discuss specific entries it should be clear from the context which type of indexing we will be using."
